# Insomnia
Basically, Insomnia is a concept game that i plan to make in the next few weeks.

**Objective**: The objective of this game is that there are multiple rooms in a large house, our goal is to explore each and every room, free the spirit in the room either by solving certain puzzles or fighting the spirits directly

In the end, you basically attain the key to get out of the house.

**Inspiration**: [Solo Leveling](https://mangareader.to/solo-leveling-21) and [One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece)
